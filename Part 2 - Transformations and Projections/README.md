# Part 2 - Transformations and Projections

The goal of this part is to be able to apply transformations to the virtual object, and project the object's vertices' 3D coordinates into pixel coordinates.

# Demo
The demo shows how to use the functions to apply the transformations and then photograph the object and display the image.
